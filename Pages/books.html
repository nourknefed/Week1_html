        <dd> <em>Geoff Dembicki</em> </dd>
        <dt><strong>Description</strong></dt>
        <dd>Dembicki, a Canadian investigative reporter, has written a dark tale of money corrupting politics and
          paralyzing the
          public will. He shows how oil companies were studying climate science as a top priority during the 1970s.
          Executives
          were briefed and advised to act quickly to solve the problem. Instead, the fossil fuel industry acted to
          deceive the
          public, fighting a long war against the science of global warming — a science, ironically, that it had been
          instrumental
          in creating. For those who want a no-frills account of how we ended up on the climate precipice, this is an
          essential
          read</dd>

        <dd> <em>By Hua Hsu</em> </dd>
        <dt><strong>Description</strong></dt>
        <dd>In this thoughtful, affecting book, Hsu questions the possibility of meaning in tragedy. In college, Hsu
          became unlikely
          friends with Ken, whose mainstream tastes and interests couldn’t have been more different from his. Ken was
          murdered
          early one morning in 1998 by robbers who were strangers. Hsu describes the aftermath with devastating
          emotional
          precision. But while tragic, “Stay True” also succeeds as a wry chronicle of the insecurities of youth and of
          college
          life and culture during the 1990s. With warmth and humor, Hsu has produced an extraordinary, devotional act of
          friendship.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Description</strong></dt>
        <dd>Trust” is about an early-20th-century investor. Or at least it seems to be. Framed as a novel, it is
          actually an
          intricately constructed quartet of stories. The first luxuriates in the tragic fate of America’s wealthiest
          man,
          Benjamin Rask. In the second, Rask tells his own story. In the third and fourth, the testimonials of those who
          knew him
          reveal more of the truth. Diaz is interested in the way wealthy men burnish their image and how that process
          involves
          the diminishment of others. In summary “Trust” might sound overcomplicated, but in execution it’s an elegant,
          irresistible puzzle</dd>
