    <p>Will Smith stars in this moving tale inspired by the true story of Chris Gardner, a San Francisco salesman struggling to
    build a future for himself and his 5-year-old son Christopher (Jaden Smith). When his girlfriend Linda (Thandie Newton)
    walks out, Chris is left to raise Christopher (Jaden Smith) on his own. Chris' determination finally pays off when he
    lands an unpaid internship in a brutally competitive stockbroker-training program, where only one in twenty interns will
    make the cut. But without a salary, Chris and his son are evicted from their apartment and are forced to sleep on the
    streets, in homeless shelters and even behind the locked doors of a metro station bathroom. With self-confidence and the
    love and trust of his son, Chris Gardner rises above his obstacles to become a Wall Street legend.</p>
